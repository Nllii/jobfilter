# jobfilter

I'm sick of searching. Get all the searches in one CSV, hopefully that helps me get a job
that pays more.

```run jobfilter.py ```

## Things todo, that don't really improve the quality of the program.

- [ ] Remove api_keys.
- [ ] finish writing the functions to include search parameters.
- [ ] use pandas to fix the CSV.
- [ ] clean data.
