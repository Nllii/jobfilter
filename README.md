I'm sick of searching. Get all the searches in one CSV, hopefully that helps me get a job
that pays more.

main file:  ```jobfilter.py ```

## Things todo, that don't really improve the quality of the program.
Important: Implement a filter and add a cool visualizer.


- [ ] Remove api_keys.
- [ ] Finish indeed? (http://jooble.org) ... Need to find duplicated  and remove it. 
- [ ] Finish terminal options
- [ ] finish writing the functions to include search parameters.
- [ ] use pandas to fix the CSV.
- [ ] clean data.
